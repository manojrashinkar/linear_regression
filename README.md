# Home Price Prediction App

This is a simple web application built using Streamlit that predicts home prices based on the area in square feet. The application utilizes a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between area and price, providing a visual representation of the data along with prediction capabilities.

## Features

- Load and display a dataset of home prices.
- Interactive input for area to predict the corresponding home price.
- Visual representation of the data through scatter plots.
- Display of the best-fit line for the data points.
- Equation of the regression line and predicted price based on user input.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Prerequisites

To run this app, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manojrashinkar/home-price-prediction-app.git
   cd home-price-prediction-app
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. Place your `homeprices.csv` file in the same directory as the script.

## Running the App

To run the app, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with the name of your Python file if it's different.

## Usage

- Enter the area in square feet in the input box.
- The predicted price will be displayed along with a scatter plot showing existing data points and the best-fit line.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the Streamlit team for providing an easy-to-use platform for building web apps with Python.
